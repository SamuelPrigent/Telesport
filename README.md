# Quickstart OlympicGamesStarter

- Node version required for the project is 18.0.3 [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

- Don't forget to install your node_modules before starting (`npm install`).

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server `http://localhost:4200/`. App will automatically reload if you change any files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# ts

Once mastered, you should continue by creating the typescript interfaces inside the `models` folder. As you can see I already created two files corresponding to the data included inside the `olympic.json`. With your interfaces, improve the code by replacing every `any` by the corresponding interface.
